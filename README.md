# Hi there 👋


I currently work as a solutions engineer at a SaaS company after almost a decade of doing IT / Apple Device Management.

🧑🏽‍💻 You may recognize me from such projects as:
* [SystemPreferences](https://github.com/bvanpeski/SystemPreferences) - Catalog of all System Settings interfaces that you can interact with via script.
* [UnActivationLock](https://github.com/bvanpeski/unActivationLock) - A zsh script that detects if a device is activation locked and prompts the user to log out of FindMy so that your MDM can lay down an activation lock bypass.
* [ScreenNudge](https://github.com/bvanpeski/ScreenNudge) - A zsh script designed to prompt the end-user to approve screen recording for a given app BEFORE they need it or launch it for the first time.

📫 How to reach me:
* You can read my blog at https://macosadventures.com
* I'm @brianvp on the [MacAdmins Slack](https://www.macadmins.org/)
